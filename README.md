# hex_removal
Removes the fake header of Unity files, so programs like AssetStudio can load it without problems.


Ussage: 

Run hexremoval.py, paste the folder that contains your unity files, and hit enter.
A new Folder with the same name with "_Extracted" Attached will show up.
This new Folder will contain all the files with the fake header removed.
